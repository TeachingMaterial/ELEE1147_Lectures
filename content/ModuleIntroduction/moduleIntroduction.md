## Module Aims

This module aims to increases awareness of the uses of programming in engineering and the types of software systems it could be used in, for example an information collection system. It helps [you] to develop skills in algorithm design and the application of a high-level computer language to implement such a design. This will require [you] to develop an understanding of the types of software engineering methodologies used in industry as well as a perspective of how they would be implemented.

## Module Learning Outcomes 

On successful completion of this module a student will be able to:

[1] Analyse the requirements of a system and develop an algorithm to meet this requirement

[2] Explore techniques for the processing and manipulation of complex data structures, specifically with respect to software systems

[3] Implement an algorithm in a high-level computer language and develop a test schedule to confirm its correct operation

[4] Demonstrate a reflective attitude to programming methods and show why the method and algorithm used was chosen, particularly verification via the use of “ground-truth data”

## Indicative Content

**Software Design Process**

- The design of algorithms to efficiently solve a specific problem or a class of problems, the use of suitable notation such as Structured English, state machines, flowcharts to document the design using formal software engineering methods.

**High Level Programming**

- Basic data types, control flow, functions, parameter passing, bitwise operations, pointers, reading and writing I/O interfaces, complex data structures both in the procedural and object-oriented context, object-oriented concepts and constructs
